# Adapters

> Run h3 everywhere using adapters.

The [app instance](/guide/app) of h3 is lightweight without any logic about runtime it is going to run.
Using h3 adapters, we can easily integrate server with each runtime.

There are 3 base adapters:

- [Node.js](/adapters/node)
- [Web](/adapters/web)
- [Plain](/adapters/plain)

Also see guides for specific runtimes:

- [Bun](/adapters/bun)
- [Cloudflare](/adapters/cloudflare)
- [Deno](/adapters/deno)
- [Netlify](/adapters/netlify)
