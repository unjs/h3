# Getting Started

> Getting started with h3

## Overview

h3 (short for HTTP, pronounced as /eɪtʃθriː/, like h-3) is a lightweight, ultra fast and [composable](/utils) server framework for JavaScript based on Web standards working on any JavaScript runtime.

## Quick Start

Install `h3` as a dependency:

:pm-install{name="h3"}

Create a new file `server.mjs`:

```ts [server.mjs]
import { H3, serve } from "h3";

const app = new H3();

app.get("/", () => "⚡️ Tadaa!");

await serve(app, { port: 3000 })
  .ready()
  .then((server) => {
    console.log(`🚀 Server ready at ${server.url}`);
  });
```

Then, run the server using your favorite runtime:

::code-group

```bash [node]
node --watch ./server.mjs
```

```bash [deno]
deno run -A --watch ./server.mjs
```

```bash [bun]
bun run --watch server.mjs
```

::

And tadaa! We have a web server running locally.

### What happened?

Okay, let's now break down our hello world example.

We first created an [h3 app instance](/guide/app) using `new H3()`:

```ts
const app = new H3(/* optional config */);
```

`app` is a tiny server capable of matching routes, generating response and handling lifecycle hooks such as errors.

Then we create register a route for handling HTTP GET requests to `/` path.

```ts
app.get("/", () => {
  return { message: "⚡️ Tadaa!" };
});
```

::tip
Router is powered by [🌳 rou3](https://github.com/unjs/rou3), an ultra fast and tiny route matcher engine.
::

What is beautiful in h3 is that all you have to do to make a response, is to simply return it! Responses can be simple **string**, **JSON object**, **binary data**, **stream**, or standard [Web Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/Response).

Finally we use `serve` method to start the server listener.

::tip
Serve method is powered by [💥 srvx](https://srvx.unjs.io/).

<br> Based on runtime and export conditions, correct adapter will be auto loaded.
<br>You can also directly export or use `app.fetch(request)`.
::

### Using from CDN

You can directly import h3 from CDN. This method can be used for Bun, Deno and other runtimes such as Cloudflare Workers (you need an adapter).

```js
import { H3, toWebHandler } from "https://esm.sh/h3";

const app = new H3();

export const fetch = app.fetch;
```
